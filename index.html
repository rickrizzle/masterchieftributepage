            <h3>Here's a timeline of Master Chief's Life and Major Accomplishments</h3>
            <li><strong>2511</strong>- Born in Elysium City on the colony world Eridanus II.</li> 
            <li><strong>2517</strong> - John-117 is abducted along with other portential SPARTAN II candidates. </li>
            <li><strong>2525</strong> - The Spartan candidates undergo biological augmenation. Of 75 candidates, only 33 both survive the process and
                remain active. John-117 is 14 years old.</li>
            <li><strong>2525</strong> - Participates in his first active military operations for the UNSC.</li>
            <li><strong>2552</strong> - The final events in the "Fall of Reach" story take place. Master Chief and the other Spartans participate in the doomed defense of the important military hub world: planet Reach.
            This battle immediately precedes the events of the first <em>Halo</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>2552</strong> - Events of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>. This is where most of us are introduced to Master Chief as we know and love him today.</li>
            <li><storng>2553</storng> - Ending of <em>Halo 3</em>. Master Chief successfully defeats the remaining Covenant forces loyal to the Brutes and Prophets. Master Chief, with the help of the Arbiter, also prevent the Flood from taking over all life in the Universe, and without activating the Halo rings. 
                In the final cutscenes, Master Chief is presumed KIA back on Earth after being separated from the Arbiter. However, he and Cortana are stranded in space. His final words to her before entering cryo-sleep are: "Wake me up when you need me."

    <p>
        “He is neither the smartest, nor the fastest, nor the strongest of the Spartans. But he is the bravest, and quite possibly the luckiest. And in my opinion, he is the best.”
